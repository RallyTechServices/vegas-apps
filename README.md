==========

This is a series of apps for a customer, some of which were modified from 
code sourced originally elsewhere.

### taskboard

This is the original (very old) code for the taskboard that shows tasks arranged
in columns that are their state and rows that are their workproducts.  The **additions**:

* The pencil on each task now launches the regular pop up edit dialog for changing anything on
  the task itself.
* The FormattedID of each item is now a link to its details page
* The new plus sign on each workproduct starts the creation process for a task and pops up an edit dialog

### ProjectBurnChart

This is a modification of a customer-created app that provides a great many things with respect to showing
a progress chart.  This addition is to limit the data by release.

### owner_grid

This is a grid of stories owned by a selected user.  The exciting bit is that sorting on the release or iteration sorts by end date of that timebox.

### iteration_summary_by_completion

Change the iteration summary app so that completion is the marker for done instead of accepted.

### adjust_iterations

Show a table of sprints so that the user can set the planned velocity based on aaverage velocity
