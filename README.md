==========

This is a series of apps for a customer, some of which were modified from 
code sourced originally elsewhere.

### taskboard

This is the original (very old) code for the taskboard that shows tasks arranged
in columns that are their state and rows that are their workproducts.  The **additions**:

* The pencil on each task now launches the regular pop up edit dialog for changing anything on
  the task itself.
* The FormattedID of each item is now a link to its details page
* The new plus sign on each workproduct starts the creation process for a task and pops up an edit dialog

### ProjectBurnChart

This is a modification of a customer-created app that provides a great many things with respect to showing
a progress chart.  This addition is to limit the data by release.
